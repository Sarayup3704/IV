This web-based visualization system allows users to interactively explore a film dataset using D3.js. It features three coordinated charts—a bullet chart, scatter plot, and treemap—linked through filters for Genre, Director, and Awards. Users can hover for insights, zoom into data, and highlight genres across all charts for deeper analysis.
